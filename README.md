This repo is a starter kit for front-end developers, non-gulp or gulp, so developers can easily start a new project without setting up everything all over again. For new users, refer to the guide below.

### For non-gulp users:
Use `bootstrap` folder _(I recommend you to start using gulp ASAP, it's a life changer)_

### For gulp users
Use `bootstrap-scss-gulp` and please refer to the guide below if you're not particularly familiar with gulp.

Basically, there are two versions that would suit both non-gulp and gulp users: one is very basic that contain index.html and essential bootstrap files, another contain index.html, essential bootstrap files and gulp with features listed below.

To request a new version and feature or report a bug, please open an issue.

### bootstrap
* `assets/css/bootstrap.min.css`
* `assets/js/jquery.1.11.3.min.js`
* `assets/js/bootstrap.min.js`
* `index.html`

### bootstrap-scss-gulp
* `gulp/gulpfile.js`
* `gulp/package.json`
* `assets/css/bootstrap.min.css`
* `assets/scss/main.scss`
* `assets/js/vendors/jquery.1.11.3.min.js`
* `assets/js/vendors/bootstrap.min.js`
* `index.html`

Gulp has the following tasks:
* BrowserSync (automatically refresh working files in browser on save)
* SASS/SCSS compiler (automatically compiles SCSS to CSS on save)
* Plumber (prevents gulp crash on SASS/SCSS error)
* Notify (SASS/SCSS compile error tray notification)
* CSS minifier (minifies main.min.css)

### How to run gulp
_Note: If this is your first time, please refer to 'For gulp beginners' section below._

##### 1. CD to a directory 'gulp' containing `gulpfile.js`
##### 2. Install dependencies
```
npm install --save-dev
```

##### 3. Start compiling, serving, and watching files
```
gulp
```

### For gulp beginners:

##### 1. Terminal
**Notice: If you have trouble installing custom terminal, I wrote more in-detailed guide [here](https://github.com/dmxt/beginner-gulp-tutorial-on-windows#step-1---terminal-windows).**

You need terminal to use npm and gulp. Terminal is available out of the box on Linux and OS X.

Windows has it as well but cmd and PowerShell is not sustainable for development work (I've met some people who prefer it, well, to each their own). I recommend you to install [cmder](http://cmder.net/) as a replacement for Windows terminal and use their custom cmd.exe (`cmd /k "%ConEmuDir%\..\init.bat"` instead of default PowerShell). If you have runtime error when starting cmder, you'll probably need to install VS 2015, see [the issue here](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/501). 

Learn terminal basics [here](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html), this guide is short and will help you in long run. _Seriously. What are you going to do if you can't even change directory in terminal without looking up?_

##### 2. npm
Install [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This is available for all operating system. During the installation for Windows, be sure 'add to PATH' is included ([image](http://i.imgur.com/lHiNR7p.png)). When installed, restart cmder and enter `npm` in terminal to see if it's working properly, as in it should tell you the usage information. If it does, proceed to the next step.

##### 3. gulp
Install gulp globally with this terminal command: `npm install --global gulp`

On completion, download this repo and extract bootstrap-scss-gulp to any folder. Follow the instruction in bootstrap-scss-gulp section on this readme by running `npm install --save-dev`, then run `gulp`. Default browser should open the index.html and will refresh on file save when you edit files.
